<h1>SQLAlchemy Challenge</h1>

<p>In this activity, we were tasked with performing some climate analysis for a potential vacation to Honolulu, Hawaii.<br/></p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>The analysis can be found in the climate_starter.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file.</p>
<p>I had to utilize internet resources for a handful of coding problems. I have the URLs listed here as well as commented out in the code itself</p>
<ul>

  <li>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28033656/finding-most-frequent-values-in-column-of-array-in-sql-alchemy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Flask App</h2>
<p>The Flask app can be found in the app.py Python file</p>
<p>Unlike the analysis, I did not have to utilize any sources outside of revisiting class materials.</p>
